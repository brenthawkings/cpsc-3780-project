Two programs are included (in their own respective directories), receiver.cpp and sender.cpp.

Inside the Sender Directory there is a file called text.txt which is intended to be sent.

From the sender directory:
To make sender.cpp enter command: make -f senderMake 
This will produce sender.exe
To run sender.exe enter command: ./sender.exe "filename" "host" "port" 

From the receiver directory:
To make receiver.cpp enter command: make -f receiverMake 
This will produce receiver.exe
To run receiver.exe enter command: ./receiver.exe "filename" "port"
